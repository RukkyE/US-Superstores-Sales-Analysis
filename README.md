# US-Superstores-Sales-Analysis
A repository for the analysis of the sales performance of superstores in 4 major states in the United States of America. <br />
The datasets used for this project are included in the repository. <br />

## Introduction
In this project, I analysed the records of superstores sales in 4 major states (Arizona, California, New Mexico and Texas) in the United States of America from the year 2018 and 2019. <br />
The aim of the project is to;
* Analyse the sales trend from the beginning of 2018 to the end of 2019. <br />
* Increase the revenue to be generated for the following year. <br />
* Analyse revenue generated by state, customer name, sales person and item sold. <br />
* Retarget customers who ordered but did not purchase items. <br />

## Data Exploration
The dataset of this project contains 1 Microsoft Excel file which I imported into Microsoft PowerBI. I checked for duplicate records but discovered there was none because each row in the dataset represents the record for each sale made each day. The following are some of the key insights I generated;
* Total Revenue Generated = $2,028,591
* Total Quantity Sold = 9,119
* Total Order Made = 2,000
* Total Order Purchased = 1,823
* Average Price Per Item = $223.67
* Total Number of Sales Person = 8
